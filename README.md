# Kathir 👋  
**Data Engineer | MSc Data Science | UK**

I build **reliable, analytics-ready data pipelines** with a strong focus on  
**SQL-first modelling, ETL/ELT workflows, and data quality**.

🌍 Based in the UK  
💼 Open to **Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer** roles  

---

## 🧠 What I focus on
- Designing clean **analytics schemas** (facts, dimensions, marts)
- Building **repeatable ETL/ELT pipelines**
- Writing **clear, performant SQL**
- Adding **data quality checks** so bad data fails fast
- Documenting transformations so teams trust the numbers

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages**
- SQL 
- Python

**Data Engineering**
- ETL / ELT pipelines
- dbt (models, tests, docs)
- Airflow (DAGs, scheduling)

**Data & Ops**
- Pandas
- Docker
- Git
- Linux (basic)
- AWS S3 (storage basics)

---

## 📂 Featured Projects (in progress)
> Repositories will be added as projects are completed.

- **End-to-End ELT Pipeline**  
  Raw → staging → marts, reproducible Docker setup, data quality checks

- **SQL Business Case Studies**  
  Cohorts, funnels, retention analysis, window functions, query optimisation

- **Streaming Data Pipeline**  
  Event ingestion, consumers, idempotency, near real-time outputs

---

## 🧩 How I work
- Start with **business questions**, then design the data model
- Prefer **simple, readable SQL** over clever queries
- Automate pipelines so they are **reliable and repeatable**
- Treat data quality as a **first-class feature**
