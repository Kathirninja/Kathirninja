##Hi
# Kathir 👋  
**Data Analyst | MSc Data Science | UK**

I turn complex data into **clear, actionable insights** using a **SQL-first analytics approach**, supported by robust data modelling, reliable pipelines, and strong data quality practices.

🌍 Based in the UK  
💼 Open to **Data Analyst / Analytics Analyst / Risk & Operations Analyst** roles  

---

## 🧠 What I focus on
- Translating **business questions into analytical frameworks and KPIs**
- Writing **clear, performant SQL** for exploration, reporting, and deep dives
- Building **analytics-ready datasets** (facts, dimensions, marts)
- Performing **cohort, funnel, retention, and trend analysis**
- Ensuring **data quality and consistency** so insights are decision-ready
- Communicating findings clearly to **technical and non-technical stakeholders**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Analytics & Querying
- SQL (CTEs, window functions, optimisation)
- Python (pandas, NumPy)

### Analytics Engineering (to support analysis)
- dbt (models, tests, documentation)
- Airflow (scheduled pipelines)
- AWS S3, Redshift / Athena (foundations)

### Tools & Workflow
- Pandas
- Git
- Docker (reproducible analysis environments)
- Linux (basic)

## 📂 Featured Analytics Projects (in progress)
> Repositories will be added as projects are completed.

- **End-to-End Analytics Pipeline**  
  Raw → staging → analytics marts with documented metrics and data quality checks

- **SQL Business Case Studies**  
  Cohort analysis, funnels, retention, KPI tracking, and query optimisation

- **Event & Behavioural Analysis**  
  Event-based datasets analysed for trends, anomalies, and user behaviour patterns

---

## 🧩 How I work
- Start with the **business problem**, not the tool
- Prefer **simple, readable SQL** over over-engineered solutions
- Validate data before trusting outputs
- Focus on **insights that drive action**, not just dashboards
- Document assumptions so stakeholders trust the numbers
